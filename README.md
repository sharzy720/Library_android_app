# Library_android_app
This is an android app that allows for you to catalog your collection of books.

Your library is easily accessed through the library button where all of the books in the database are shown. By entering either a title, author, or isbn number and selecting the respective switch you can search the library. Selecting a book will bring up the details page where all the information about a given book is displayed.

Adding a book to your library is simple all you do is press the add book button and enter the books isbn number and press search. The app will then search the [Open Library database](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api) for relevent information like the books title, author, and cover. To add the book to the library simply press the add to library button
